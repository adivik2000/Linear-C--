     Linear C++

What it is
==========
This is a library for doing linear algebra in C++. So far it includes:

- a Matrix class
- RowVector and ColumnVector classes
- basic Matrix and Vector operations such as multiplication,
  addition, and length (for RowVector and ColumnVector)
- convenience methods for populating randomly or making identity matrices
- a method for solving a system of linear equations via Gauss-Jordan

Why
===
I realize that many better packages exist for Linear Algebra in C++.
This library is not suitable for any intensive computation, but it's
a great way to gain expertise in both Linear Algebra and C++.

My goal with this project is to gain a better understanding of both.

- Make LU Decomposition work with any matrix, not just square matrices.
- Factor out common code in gaussian elimination, gauss jordan, and LU decomposition if possible.
- make the findNonZero function return the max value in that column instead of the first non-zero value. Same linear running time, but this is a *lot* better numerically speaking, especially since we're using doubles.
- find the rank of a matrix.
- LUsolve: automatically choose the right method to solve the matrix (gaussian elimination, cholesky decomposition, etc).

- Make LU Decomposition work with any matrix, not just square matrices.
- Factor out common code in gaussian elimination, gauss jordan, and LU decomposition if possible.
- make the findNonZero function return the max value in that column instead of the first non-zero value. Same linear running time, but this is a *lot* better numerically speaking, especially since we're using doubles.
- find the rank of a matrix.
- LUsolve: automatically choose the right method to solve the matrix (gaussian elimination, cholesky decomposition, etc).

- Currently, converting from matrix to columnvector or rowvector doesn't check the size of the matrix. add this functionality (some commented-out code alreadys exists in Matrix.cpp)
- add routine to find the rank of a matrix.
